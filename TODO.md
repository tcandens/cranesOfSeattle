# TODO

## API
* Use a test database, probably a docker container that is not run through main
docker-compose file. Perhaps a separate test-compose.
* Perhaps knex.js is not a bad idea. Learning about SQL and how to manage connections
is great, but slow.
* Setup a watch task to auto-run tests.
* Version the api.
